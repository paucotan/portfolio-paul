This portfolio reflects a belief in **individual empowerment through open-source technology**. Every project showcased here aims to put knowledge and power back in people's hands, whether it's financial literacy, workflow optimization, or personal growth tools.

Technology is viewed as a **living ecosystem** — a network of interconnected nodes working synergistically with the whole rather than as isolated parts. This multidisciplinary perspective draws connections between economics and code, systems thinking and user experience, personal growth and collective progress.
