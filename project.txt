About section:
Full Stack Developer | Le Wagon Graduate | Customer Support Specialist | Tech for Social Impact

I'm a full stack developer with a foundation in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and SQL, recently graduating from Le Wagon's intensive bootcamp. With 4+ years as a Customer Support Agent at Fairphone, I've developed a unique perspective that combines technical problem-solving with a deep understanding of user needs.

My professional experience spans technical troubleshooting, process automation, and sustainable project management across multiple countries. At Fairphone, I've resolved complex hardware/software issues while creating internal tools and optimizing workflows to improve both team efficiency and customer satisfaction.

I'm passionate about building technology that serves meaningful purposes - whether improving user experiences, supporting sustainable practices, or solving practical problems. This passion is demonstrated in projects like Dealhuntr, a grocery deal aggregator that helps people save money through real-time data scraping.
