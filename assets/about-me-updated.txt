 About Me

I’m a full-stack developer with the soul of a systems thinker and the instincts of a guide — drawn to where clarity meets complexity, and tools become portals to deeper understanding.

Before I wrote code, I spent 4+ years at Fairphone, supporting users through high-stakes technical challenges. There, I learned to navigate turbulence with calm, empathy, and precision — skills that now shape how I build software: with people at the center. I was also drawn to their mission — proving that ethics and sustainability can be core to business, not just a ‘nice-to-have’.

I see technology as a living ecosystem — a network of interconnected nodes working in synergy. I build tools that return agency to the user and deepen awareness, rather than overwhelm it.

My work spans intuitive budgeting tools, workflow assistants, and financial literacy journeys — all designed to empower through clarity, usefulness, and values-aligned design.

Bridging Eastern and Western perspectives, my multicultural experience shapes a broader, more empathetic approach to problem-solving and design.

I’m drawn to projects that empower, illuminate, or harmonize. If that resonates, let’s connect
